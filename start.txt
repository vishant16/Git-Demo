How git works

Lifecycle of Git

1.Local
  Working directory
  staging area
  .git folder
2.Remote

-when we create new file, it will be in "working directory" but when we git add it goes to staging area
after git commit it goes to .git folder.



commands
git init
git status
git add .
git commit -m "messages."
git push origin master

git pull origin master (to push down the remote changes to our local repository)

git ls-files (to track all files)

git reset HEAD filename
  -it unstage the file means put back to working directory from staging area or undo git add

git checkout -- filename
  - it undo the changes we have done or to discard changes in working directory

Linux commands

mkdir -p folder/folder to make tree structured directories
ok
